This repository is a general set of tools for parsing and analyzing NBA play-by-play data;
methods are primarly those from 82games.com and basketballvalue.com, among others; data is 
primarily obtained from basketballvalue.com, though apparently espn has all of the data 
available online as well;

02/03/12 Update:
Just finished with some changes to the code, and it's up and running w/ a new 'player' and
'game' class to carry around / organize data while parsing the play-by-play (will upload
new stuff soon).  Still need to work out a minutes / time tracker for players and a 
"who's on the floor" tracker as well.


29/02/12
The NBA_runparse.py used to (yesterday, before I started changing stuff around and adding
a player and game class to track data over a season) run the play-by-play parsing for a 
single game, obtaining the typical set of game stats (except for minutes played.  I still
need to create that module.  Also, I need to add a module for tracking who is on the court
at a given time.  This would be trivial if the play-by-play listed the starting 5, but no).  
In other words, there is no way to run the code in the manner intended at the moment.
